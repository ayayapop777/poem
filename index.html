            <p>If anyone asked me about love, I'd tell them about you.<br>
            I'd tell them how it feels to be nurtured<br>
            And cared for<br>
            Without condition.<br>
            I'd tell them how you look at me with sparkling eyes,<br>
            A constant smile on your face,<br>
            And the overwhelming sense of certainty.<br>
            I'd tell them how love can be safe,<br>
            And warm,<br>
            And easy.<br>
            I'd tell them that love is worth it.<br>
            That there's nothing more beautiful than letting love in</p>

        <p>You are so special to me. You don't even know. I hate when you are hard on yourself because you don't deserve that negativity. You deserve everything good and I will try my best to give that to you. I'm not perfect, but I want to be the best I can for you. I want to help you reach your goals and see you succeed. I want to support you for as long as you let me. You are very important to me. Thank you for being you. I love you.</p>
